# A Bird Song

It's a year almost that I have not seen her:<br />
Oh, last summer green things were greener,<br />
Brambles fewer, the blue sky bluer.

It's surely summer, for there's a swallow:<br />
Come one swallow, his mate will follow,<br />
The bird race quicken and wheel and thicken.

Oh happy swallow whose mate will follow<br />
O'er height, o'er hollow! I'd be a swallow,<br />
To build this weather one nest together.

-- _*Christina Georgina Rossetti*_<br />
